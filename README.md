Generates a recursive descent parser

After seeing a lot of the Programming Languages class people writing their Wren Recursive Descent Parser, and having to write this program for my compilers class, I figure I'd post the source so maybe someone could benefit from its generated code.

I may add a watermark to the generated code so Dr. Fenwick can weed out the people using this program to cheat on their Programming Languages lab ;)
